## Difference Between `npm run dev` and `npm run preview` (Vite)

- `npm run dev`:  
  Runs the development server with fast, unoptimized builds. Supports hot module replacement (HMR) for instant updates during coding. Used for active development.

- `npm run preview`:  
  Serves the optimized, production-ready build from the `dist` folder. No hot reload. Used to preview exactly how the app will behave after deployment.
